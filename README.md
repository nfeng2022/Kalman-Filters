# Kalman-filters
Two classes for standard Kalman filter and extended Kalman filter are implemented for two benchmark problems.  

## Dependency
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Benchmark
The standard Kalman filter is applied to predict the state variables from a linear Gaussian process system which is composed of a evoluation model and a measurement model. The corresponding problem statement can be summarized as follows:
